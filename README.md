# Telco Customer Churn Analysis
## Introduction and Problem Statement

In the competitive telecommunications industry, customer retention is crucial for sustainable growth. This project analyses the patterns, reasons, and likelihood of customer churn to develop actionable strategies to reduce customer churn and retain high-value customers. The analysis was performed using Power BI and focuses on understanding customer demographics, service patterns, and churn reasons.

## Key Objectives
1.	Analyse the customer churn rate 
2.	Investigate the impact of customer churn in the telecom industry as a whole
3.	Explore top reasons for customer churn.
4.	Identify high-value customers with high churn risk to develop retention strategies

## Data Analysis Process and Approach
A comprehensive dataset for a fictional Telco company containing customer demographics, service details, and churn metrics data was imported into Power BI.

Calculated fields were created to derive metrics such as churn rate, revenue lost, and high churn risk categories.

## Results and Insights
- Month-to-Month contracts and electronic check payment methods are major churn drivers.
- Fiber Optic users exhibit higher churn, possibly due to service dissatisfaction or competitive offers.
- Churn is prevalent among customers with no dependents or senior citizens, suggesting targeted support could reduce churn in these groups.
- $2.86M in revenue is lost due to churn, indicating significant financial implications for the organization.
- Competitor offers and customer service issues are primary churn reasons, indicating areas for immediate improvement.

## Recommendations
Based on the insights from the dashboard, the below is recommended:

1.	Customer Retention Programs:
o	Focus on Month-to-Month contract customers by offering incentives for switching to longer-term contracts.
o	Provide loyalty programs or discounts for senior citizens and customers without dependents.
2.	Service Quality Improvement:
o	Address service issues for Fiber Optic customers through enhanced technical support and competitive pricing.
o	Improve customer service and support to reduce churn caused by poor support experiences.
3.	Targeted Retention for High-Value Customers:
o	Deploy personalised retention strategies for high value customers with high churn scores. Benefits such as data upgrades, price reductions, or exclusive offers could decrease their churn scores.
4.	Payment Method Optimisation:
o	Encourage churn-prone electronic check users to switch to automated bank transfers or credit card payments by highlighting benefits.
5.	Competitor Strategy Analysis:
o	Conduct competitive benchmarking to address gaps in offers related to download speeds, data limits, and pricing.
